# Create development certificates the easy way!

If you're a web developer and need to test your websites locally on HTTPs, you probably don't want to buy an SSL certificate for this.

Instead, you want to **generate your own certificates**! ðŸ’ª

However, working with the `openssl` CLI can be intimidating. Options are hard to remember. So I've put together these scripts and instructions to make my life, and yours, easier!

## Download

Right click below, *Save Link As...*:

- [create-ca.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenMorel/dev-certificates/main/create-ca.sh)
- [create-certificate.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenMorel/dev-certificates/main/create-certificate.sh)

## Generate your own Certificate Authority

The *Certificate Authority* is what will make your browser trust the certificates that you'll generate for your development domains. Your browser is bundled with a list of Certificate Autorities that it trusts by default, but because you'll be signing your certificates yourself, you need to instruct it to trust your own certificates.

Just run:

```
create-ca.sh 
```

![create-ca.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenMorel/dev-certificates/main/images/create-ca.png)

You only need to perform this step **once**.

## Generate a certificate for your domain

To generate a certificate for `example.dev` and its subdomains, run:

```
create-certificate.sh example.dev
```

![create-certificate.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenMorel/dev-certificates/main/images/create-certificate.png)

You can now install the `.key` and `.crt` files in your web server, such as Apache or Nginx.

Repeat this step if you need certificates for other domain names.

## Import the CA in your browser

You only need to perform this step **once** for each browser, whatever the number of certificates you'll generate.

## That's it!

If you need to create certificates for other domains, just run `create-certificate.sh` again.
**No need to create or import the CA again!**

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
